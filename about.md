I'm Enrico HÃ¶schler, but on most sites you'll see me as ddmler. Currently I'm studying computer science at a german university.

I started writing code when I was about 12 years old. At first I wanted to become a video game developer like probably everyone at this age does, though pretty soon I figured out that my real passion is with web development, IT security and DevOps so I'll probably write mostly about those three topics here.
