I'm Enrico HÃ¶schler, but on most sites you'll see me as ddmler. Currently I'm studying computer science at a german university.

I wrote my first code when I was about 12 years old, since then I knew what I wanted to do. My main passions are web development, IT security and DevOps so I'll probably write mostly about those three topics here, but I'm also interested in a lot of other things so maybe there will be some other stuff too.
